We’re not saying this involves a beer keg, guitars, and campfires. But we’re not saying it doesn’t.

We are managing our growth. We continue to promote and nurture the open, collaborative nature of who we are and how we work. And we don’t just support each other in the office. The number of musicians in-house is pretty overwhelming, from 90s cover bands to death metal. There’s always a co-worker with a gig coming up and we love to go out and cheer them on.

Our new initiative is looking for a few talented designers and developers to work with a small, high-power team of industry experts to launch a Cybersecurity product line. Focused on providing network cybersecurity threat and incident correlation, analytics and visualization we’re using state-of-the-art tools and a modern stack to support advanced use cases.

The current challenge we face is to accumulate, process and eloquently present data streams of network data from various sources, ranging in the hundreds of millions of entries per day. Being able to determine what are useful combinations of data vs false positives is a key objective.

What You Will Do

We want you to be a part of an awesome team as we define the direction and initial product launch. We operate in a “You build it, you run it” mode, where everyone is actively participating in maintaining and improving running software.

We require someone that can analyze the data that we receive, research and propose models for data analysis, and participate in the development of solutions that can be applied to real-time data feed so that real-time insight on the network state can be provided to our customer. We are particularly interested in developing correlation detection and failure prediction analysis, where we can train a model from actual network data to forecast its quality of service over time.

As part of the Skylight Cybersecurity team for Accedian, we are looking for a data scientist that will help us discover information and patterns in large amounts of collected network data.

Your primary focus will be in applying data mining techniques, doing statistical analysis, and building high quality prediction systems integrated with our cybersecurity product. Ideally, you would be able to automate scoring using machine learning techniques and build systems for automated incident detection minimizing false positive incident alerts.

Responsibilities

Creating automated anomaly detection systems and constant tracking of its performance;
Data mining using state-of-the-art methods with various in-cloud data sources;
Working with the product team to extend the company’s data with third party sources of information when needed;
Enhancing data collection procedures to include information that is relevant for building analytic systems;
Processing, cleansing, and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis;
Routinely performing ad-hoc analysis and presenting results in a clear manner.

Your experience should include:

Extensive experience in applying Machine Learning algorithms to detect specific conditions and forecast dataset evolution;
Ability to work in a team where each member has a set of responsibilities, but where you would be the lead data science expert;
Experience in Telecom, mainly around deployments of data networks is a definite asset, but not an absolute requirement;
Industry experience in designing systems that are targeted to be used in production environments;
Experience in working in a fast paced, solution oriented highly functional team a definite asset.

Your Tech Skills would be:

Extensive experience with a combination of R, SAS, Stata or similar tools in the context of Machine Learning algorithms applied to real-world data;
Having a good knowledge and industry experience in a full-stack programming language a definite asset. Professional expertise in Scala, GoLang, Python or similar is strongly desired. Experience in JavaScript an asset;
Being able to develop and deploy software in a dockerized environment, or using Mesos with Spark, or in a Hadoop infrastructure is desirable.

Your Team skill set must include:

Having exceptional interpersonal skills including teamwork, facilitation and negotiation;
Having excellent English written and verbal communication skills;
Showing a strong desire to lead collaboration and open communication amongst teams, and reaching across functional borders to get to a truly awesome solution.
