340,Causal Inference and Epidemiological Studies,stat 931,"Causal inference in health research will be covered. Methods for the design and analysis of randomized controlled trials including randomization techniques, sample size and power calculations, and specialized additional topics including missing data, noncompliance, and ethics. The design and analysis of classical and modern epidemiological studies will then be discussed for settings in which randomization is not feasible. Causal inference methodologies for the analysis of observational data include propensity scores, marginal structural models and instrumental variables. Studies will be discussed from the epidemiological literature and other sources in the public domain. Simulations and data analyses will be carried out using software (e.g. R or SAS). Students will be trained and assessed in part based on the preparation of reports and delivery of presentations.",waterloo
341,Classification and Prediction in High Dimensional Analysis in Health Research,stat 932,"In this course, we will cover classification and prediction in health research with a view to applications to screening and diagnosis of disease. This will lead to methods for evaluating the performance of various types of statistical models and learning techniques/algorithms. Cross-validation and bootstrap approaches will be introduced for model performance evaluation, and we will discuss discrimination and calibration as different components of prediction performance. We will cover variable selection techniques, including for high-dimensional data, with an emphasis on regularization techniques such as the LASSO and its variants. Model validation, both internal and external, and model updating will be covered, and we will also discuss post-model selection inference. An important focus will be on biomarker evaluation for a given disease, potentially connected to therapy, and leading to coverage of precision/personalized medicine. Finally, there will be coverage on the importance of reproducible and replicable research. Examples from different problems in health, including genetics, will be presented, and software (e.g. R or SAS) will be used throughout the course.",waterloo
342,Analysis of Survival Data,stat 935,This course deals with methods of analyzing data on the time to failure with particular emphasis on the use of regression models for such data. Both parameteric and semi-parametric regression models will be considered.,waterloo

Different methods will be discussed to handle both continuous and discrete longitudinal response data, with examples from biomedical and population health datasets. Some of the approaches covered will include linear, non-linear, and generalized linear mixed effects models, as well as generalized estimating equations and transition models, with distinctions drawn between subject-specific and population averaged approaches for generalized linear longitudinal response data. Also, there will be coverage of exploratory methods, evaluation of model assumptions and adapting to assumption violations, approaches for handling missing data, and treatment of advanced topics such as semiparametric and nonparametric models for longitudinal data. Software (e.g. R or SAS) will be used throughout the course.",waterloo
