Experiments and Causal Inference,,"The most interesting decisions we make are decisions where we believe the input will change some output: redesign a customer experience to increase retention; advertise to users using this message to increase conversions; enroll in UC Berkeley data science to learn. And yet, most data is ill equipped to actually answer these questions. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Berkely
Behind the Data: Humans and Values,,"This course provides an introduction to the legal, policy, and ethical implications of data. The course will examine legal, policy, and ethical issues that arise throughout the full life cycle of data science from collection, to storage, processing, analysis and use including, privacy, surveillance, security, classification, discrimination, decisional-autonomy, and duties to warn or act. Case studies will be used to explore these issues across various domains such as criminal justice, national security, health, marketing, politics, education, automotive, employment, athletics, and development. Attention will be paid to legal and policy constraints and considerations that attach to specific domains as well as particular data-types, collection methods, and institutions. Technical, legal, and market approaches to mitigating and managing discrete and compound sets of concerns will be introduced, and the strengths and benefits of competing and complementary approaches will be explored.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Berkely

Statistical Methods ,,"Classical linear regression and time series models are workhorses of modern statistics, with applications in nearly all areas of data science. This course takes a more advanced look at both classical linear and linear regression models, including techniques for studying causality, and introduces the fundamental techniques of time series modeling. Mathematical formulation of statistical models, assumptions underlying these models, the consequence when one or more of these assumptions are violated, and the potential remedies when assumptions are violated are emphasized throughout. Major topics include classical linear regression modeling, casual inference, identification strategies, and a class of time series models that are popular among industry professionals. The course emphasizes formulating, choosing, applying, and implementing statistical techniques to capture key patterns exhibited in data. All of the techniques introduced in this course come with real-world examples and R code that is explained in weekly sessions. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to decide what techniques are appropriate for a given question, and to make trade-offs between model complexity, ease of interpreting results, and timing implementation in real-world applications. As concepts in probability theory and mathematical statistics are used extensively; students should feel comfortable with the definition, manipulation, and application of these concepts in mathematical notations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Berkely
