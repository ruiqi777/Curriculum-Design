simply apply...need more?...want to know who we are? we're a young startup, with a bold and ambitious and realistic goal: make health professionals adopt telemedicine with bliss. it all started 2 years ago, when two out-of-residency dermatologists (emilie and marc-andré) and marc-andré's brother (jean-philippe) decided there had to be a better way to care for patients. they looked around and found no such solution, so they stitched up their own. piece by piece, they built something they could love: dermago (dermago.ca) a modern virtual dermatology clinic. for a time, it was enough.but one day, a private clinic approached them to ask if they could, too, use it to enter the modern age. of course they said! yes! and dermago grew, a bit. and then another asked. and then another. so they started to grow, more steadily each time. but then, covid happened and they were flooded with demands. they sat down with a consultant, asked for advice and brainstormed. quickly, the answer was obvious: build a technology company and take all that they had learned over the last two years to build a customizable, secure, private, smart, user and doctor friendly, modern, reasonably-priced telemedicine platform. and that's what you, as a part of the technology team, will build!  ...what kind of person we need, you ask?
