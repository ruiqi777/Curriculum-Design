Chef de file mondial de l'intelligence artificielle, Element AI poursuit un objectif commun, celui d'utiliser nos vastes capacités de recherche pour développer des produits et logiciels d'IA offrant des solutions aux problèmes complexes auxquels font face les entreprises et la société en général.

Nous croyons que l'être humain doit toujours rester au cœur de tout ce que nous faisons. C'est pourquoi nous avons adopté une approche collaborative et humaine, afin que nos objectifs restent toujours éthiques et ancrés dans le réel.

L'équipe d'analyse chronologique est un équipe d'experts interdisciplinaire dont le mandat est de développer des outils basés sur l'apprentissage automatique et l'intelligence artificielle pour résoudre des problèmes industriels complexes dans les domaines des prévisions fondées sur l'analyse chronologique, de la détection d'anomalies temporelles et séquentielles, des systèmes de recommandation temporels, de la modélisation spatiotemporelle, des analyses de type « temps avant événement » et plusieurs autres.

Ce que vous ferez :

Confronté à des problèmes concrets et des jeux de données réels, vous devrez mettre à profit votre expertise et votre créativité pour appliquer les méthodes existantes (et en développer de nouvelles) afin de trouver des solutions pratiques et flexibles. Vous serez appelé à contribuer à l'évaluation de différentes possibilités et partager vos idées et vos commentaires concernant la conception des produits. Vous devrez donc évaluer et comprendre les besoins des clients (internes ou externes) pour les traduire en solutions pertinentes et applicables.

Vous devrez en outre effectuer la recherche nécessaire pour proposer des modèles et techniques appropriés et démontrer l'expertise pour mettre en place et former les modèles vous-même. Lorsque pertinent, vous n'hésiterez pas à appliquer les méthodes classiques d'apprentissage automatique, mais vous êtes également prêts à innover et repousser les frontières de l'apprentissage automatique, de l'apprentissage profond et de l'IA.

Finalement, vous devrez comprendre et accepter que la valeur de votre travail se reflète dans son impact sur l'utilisateur final de nos produits; trouver des façons de mesurer cet impact doit faire partie intégrante de votre mission.

Profil recherché :

Vous avez une expérience considérable en modélisation et en analyse chronologiques, soit en prévision en détection des anomalies. Vous avez une connaissance approfondie ou un intérêt marqué pour la théorie derrière l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres domaines de l'IA, acquise au fil de vos études, de votre expérience dans l'industrie et de projets personnels sensationnels. Vous êtes à l'aise à exprimer vos idées sous forme de code et n'avez pas peur de vous retrousser les manches et contribuer aux tâches de programmation et d'ingénierie.

Vous comprenez que de tester un modèle avec les données variées et excessives associées à un contexte commercial est différent que de le tester dans un contexte académique « propre » — vous savez que de modifier un modèle ou une technique dans un tel environnement peut représenter un défi de taille. Cela ne vous effraie pas, vous avez peut-être même de l'expérience avec ce genre de défis.

Vous apprenez de manière autonome et vous êtes toujours à l'affût des plus récentes découvertes et techniques dans votre domaine; vous êtes motivé à participer aux différentes occasions d'apprentissage que nous offrons.

Le ou la candidat(e) idéal(e) aura de l'expérience ou de bonnes connaissances touchant à un vaste éventail de sujets : modélisation chronologique, nettoyage de données, répartition, ingénierie de fonctionnalités, processus stochastiques, modèles chronologiques classiques, techniques d'apprentissage automatique pour les problèmes de régression, etc. Si vous avez déjà résolu un problème de prévision chronologique de A à Z – vous serez à votre place dans notre équipe!

Ce que nous vous offrons :

Faites équipe avec d'autres passionnés de l'IA;
Profitez d'un excellent équilibre travail-vie;
Laissez votre marque dans une industrie en plein essor;
Déployez votre talent pour affronter de nouveaux défis chaque jour;
Vous serez étonné de tout ce que vous apprendrez;
Culture d'entreprise ouverte et inclusive.

Element AI souscrit au principe de l'égalité d'accès à l'emploi et favorise la diversité au sein du personnel. Nous ne pratiquons aucune discrimination sur la base de la race, de la religion, de la couleur de peau, du pays d'origine, du sexe, de l'orientation sexuelle, de l'âge, de l'état matrimonial, du statut d'ancien combattant ou des incapacités.


Element AI is one of the world's largest artificial intelligence companies, with a shared goal of using our extensive research to develop AI products and software that will solve some of the most challenging issues facing businesses and society as a whole.

We are founded on the belief that humans should be at the heart of everything we do, and have adopted a people-first and collaborative mindset to ensure we collectively drive real and ethically-sound results.

The AI Core Time Series team is a cross-disciplinary team of experts that develops Machine Learning-based and AI-based tools for solving complex industrial problems in the fields of time series forecasting, temporal and sequential anomaly detection, temporal recommendation systems, spatio-temporal modelling, time-to-event, and the like.

What you'll do:

You will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. You will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. This will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and translating them into solutions that address those needs.

You will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. Where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical forecasting methods, but you are enthusiastic about the idea of pushing the boundaries of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI.

Finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission.

What we're looking for:

You have significant experience with time series modelling and analysis from either a forecasting or anomaly detection perspective. You also have an understanding or significant interest in the underlying theory of machine learning or related AI field. This expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. You are comfortable expressing ideas into code and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks.

You understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arise in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. You embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it.

You learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date with the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer.

The ideal candidate would have experience or familiarity with topics such as time series modelling and analysis, data cleaning, imputation, feature engineering, stochastic processes, various classical time series models, machine learning techniques for regression problems. If you have experience solving a time series forecasting problem end to end, then you'll fit right in!

What we offer for your valuable work:

Work closely with other AI enthusiasts;
Enjoy your work and life harmony;
Leave your mark in a thriving industry;
Apply your talent to tackling new challenges everyday;
Be surprised at how much you will learn;
Open and inclusive company culture.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status."

Who we are:
http://www.rideco.com

RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and vans. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, Calgary Transit, and Grab.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this new mode of transit. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.
